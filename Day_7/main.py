# SET
# Set is a collection of unique elements.
# To define the set, we use the {} curly brackets.
# Set never follows the sequence.
# When we print the set, then the sequence of values in output will be different from the sequence of input.
# Duplicate values present in a set will be printed only once in an output.
# Set uses the concept of Hash. Hash is used to improve the performance as it fetches the values as fast as possible.
# Indexing is not supported in sets as it does not follow sequencing.
# Values can not be changed in a set also because index value is not supported.

abc = {11, 35, 8, 20, 55, 11};
print(abc);
# print(abc[2]); #This cannot work

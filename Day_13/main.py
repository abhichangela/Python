# Different types of operators in Python
# Use of different operators
# Operation performed between different operators
# Logical operators and their uses

# Types of operators in Python:
# 1. Arithmetic operators
# 2. Assignment operators
# 3. Relational operators
# 4. Logical operators
# 5. Unary operators
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
# Assignment operation is performed with the help of equal to(=), in which we can assign a value to the variable.
# We can also do the assignment by short-hand which means performing an arithmetic operation and then assigning the value both at the same time.
# We can also assign the values in one line for two variables.
#  a,b = 5,6
# Unary operator takes a single operand in an expression or a statement.
# Comparison can be performed with the help of relational operators.
# Comparison operators return a boolean value or True or False.

# If you want to combine two or more conditions and then check the relation between them, then logical operators are used.
# Logical operators include And, Or and Not.
# Logical operators follow the truth table for And,  Or, and Not operators.
# And the operator returns True when both conditions are true otherwise returns False. 
# Or the operator returns True when any of the conditions or both the conditions are True otherwise it returns False.
# Not the operator reverses the value of the output.
